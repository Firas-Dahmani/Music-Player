# [Music Player](https://firas-dahmani.github.io/Music-Player/)

This is a music player interface where a user can play, pause, skip, rewind, and scrub through a song.

## Thoughts

This was a fun project for me. I remember back in the day, I used to use a program on my computer to listen to music. This took me back to those days, creating a music player. I don't know how useful this is today, with things like Spotify or Pandora.

## What i learned

-how to customize default styled element
-search and apply events and methods of audio element
-use this in inline event-handler to access information of DOM element (clientWidth , offset etc ...)
